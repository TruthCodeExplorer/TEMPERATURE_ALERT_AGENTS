- Overview
The Temperature Alert Agent is a simple script designed to help you stay informed about temperature changes in your preferred location. It allows you to set a minimum and maximum temperature range, and if the current temperature falls outside that range, it sends you a notification.

- Installation
 Before running the Temperature Alert Agent, you need to set up a few things:

1. **OpenWeatherMap API Key:** You need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and store it in a `.env` file as `api_key`.

api_key=your_api_key_here
Python Dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install uagents requests python-dotenv
Run the Agent: You can run the agent by executing the script using Python. Provide the desired location, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature when prompted.

python temperature_alert_agent.py

- Usage
 When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the following information:

City or location name
Minimum temperature (the lower threshold for your preferred range)
Maximum temperature (the upper threshold for your preferred range)
The agent will fetch the current temperature for the specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

It will then compare the current temperature to your defined temperature range.

If the current temperature falls outside your preferred range, the agent will send a notification with details about the temperature anomaly.

You will receive a desktop notification using the uagents library, but you can customize the notification method to your preference.
